# <Horisen_refactor_challenge>

## Description

I was given a on the job ticket to refactor an existing webpage. This included making the HTML as semantic as possible, add alt-text to make the site more accessible, and consolidating the CSS stylesheet within the website. I also had to make sure the website looked and ran the same way that it did before I refactored the code. My work will improve SEO results for the webpage as well as make it more accesible to people with disabilities as well as anyone else using screenreaders. I learned that every webpage has a way it can be improved and streamlined.
